    "In finance, money is often lent by those with an excess of it to those in need of it. This is only acceptable to lenders because they can expect borrowers to ultimately repay them an amount on top of the borrowed principal. This amount is called _interest_. Lenders usually set an _interest rate_ on the principal that they lend out.  \n",
