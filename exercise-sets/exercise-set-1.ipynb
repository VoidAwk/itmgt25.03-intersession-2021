    "## Brief\n",
    "\n",
    "One question people always have about programming is how it is useful in the real world. Let's put that question to rest immediately. In this exercise set, we are going to use Python to _simulate_ the spread of a virus based on how people travel.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a simulation, and why are simulations important?  \n",
    "\n",
    "To _simulate_ a system (a set of things working together) is to _imitate_ its processes. This is useful for studying these systems and for predicting how these systems will behave without having to observe the system in the real world.  \n",
    "\n",
    "One way to imitate a system is to create a set of Python objects that will interact with each other in a way that resembles how the analogous objects interact in the real world. This Python program can be run over and over with no real-world consequences, and its output can be studied to understand how the real system can be expected to behave. The Python program can also be updated to reflect new discoveries about how the objects behave. This exercise is structured around the idea of _simulating_ the spread of a virus.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This particular exercise will not result in a scientifically useful model. However, you can extend this process to implement real scientific models when you read journal articles.  "
