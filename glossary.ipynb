It's a \"thing\" that _has characteristics_ (properties) and can _do stuff_ (methods). A car has properties (its color, max speed, model, brand, etc.) and it can do stuff (drive, open doors, consume gas, etc).  \n",

The tricky part in Python is that almost _everything_ is an object, including the \"basic\" data types like numbers and strings. This is only a problem because other programming languages have \"primitive\" data types that are not \"objects\" in the programming sense of the word.  \n",
