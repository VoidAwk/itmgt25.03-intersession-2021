    "One of the great challenges of leaning to program is learning how to express yourself in code. To be a programming newcomer is, quite literally, to try to speak a language in which you are not fluent.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The way to address this fluency problem is _pseudocoding_. Pseudocoding is the process of writing out the logic of your program in a language (such as English) that you understand. This does not make you any less of a programmer: pseudocoding is an industry-accepted way of making sure that your program logic is sound.  \n",
